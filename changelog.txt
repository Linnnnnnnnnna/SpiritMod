v1.5.0.30
- Fix issues with Grouper and a Coconut projectile spawning gores on servers
- Fixed Auroras using a non-existant local player to check stuff
- Made Auroras have a 1/3 chance to spawn per night instead of 1/8 if the player (in singleplayer) / any player (in multiplayer) is in a snow biome
- Replaced Main.projectile iteration with Main.ActiveProjectile
- Fixed ElectricJellyfishOrbiter from killing dead projectiles
- Made sure all MyPlayer projectiles are owned by the player, not by everything that runs the method
- So much superfluous cleanup, let's call it microoptimization
